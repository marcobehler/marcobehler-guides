(*Editorâ€™s note*: At ~n words, you probably don't want to try reading this on a mobile device. Bookmark it and come back later.)

== Introduction

If you're a developer who has either never used Kubernetes before or wants to brush up on Kubernetes knowledge so that your DevOps colleagues will be [line-through]#scared# impressed, this guide is for you.

*Quick Question*: Why is Kubernetes abbreviated to K8s?

*Answer*: It will magically reveal itself at the end of this guide, but only after you having fully read it. So, let's not waste any more time.

=== How did we get here?

Many developers I've met throughout my career, didn't necessarily care about the "now that I've written the code, it also needs to be run somewhere"-part of application development.

What does running an application actually mean? It depends a bit on your programming language ecosystem, but in terms of Java and modern web applications, you literally compile all your source in one, single, executable .jar file, that you can run with a simple command.

[source,java]
----
java -jar myNewAIStartup.jar
----

Yes, there is additionally very likely an `_application.properties_` file involved, to set e.g. production database credentials, but the command above is literally it: If you're deploying your application on bare metal, in a VM, in a Docker container, with or without Kubernetes, or your Java-powered toaster (ok, I made that one up).

=== Running just one command can't be it. Where is the catch?

Much has been written online about the issues that can arise when deploying your application:

* What if there are version incompatibilities between my DEV environment and my PRD environment?
* What if certain, needed OS packages are missing?
* What if we're not going to deploy our application to a cloud service anymore, but a submarine?

Interestingly, your mileage with these problems will vary _a lot_ depending on what programming language ecosystem you're using, a topic that is often ignored in online discussions.

With pure Java web-applications, the issues mentioned above (apart from the submarine, of course), are essentially non-issues. You install a JDK, which is https://www.marcobehler.com/guides/a-guide-to-java-versions-and-features[insanely backwards compatible], on a server/vm/container, and run `_java -jar_`.

With PHP, Python, or Ruby the picture looks different and you could/can easily run into version incompatibilities across your dev, staging or prod environments. Hence, people yearned for a solution to rid them of these pains: Containers. (*Side-Note)

// TODO Site-Note : all these concerns aren't new....applicatikon servers etc.......schnittstellen

=== Hail to the Docker!

Chances are high that you already know what Docker is and how to work with it. (If not and you want to see a Docker specific guide, please post a comment down below! More demand -> Faster publication). The short summary is:

* You build your deployable, e.g. the `_jar_` file.
* You build a new Docker image, which contains your `_jar_` file.
* The Docker Image also contains _all_ additional software and configuration options needed to run.

-> You will now deploy your Docker image (and run it as a Docker container), instead of your .jar file. The beauty is: As long as you have Docker installed on the target machine you can run any Docker image you want (and you have Kernel compatibility between your host OS and the Docker container ).

[source,console]
----
docker run --name my-new-ai-startup -p 80:8080 -d mynewaistartup
----

This will start a Docker container on basis of the `_mynewaistartup_` Docker image. That image will, among other things, contain your e.g. -jar file, a web application which runs on port 8080, as well as instructions on how to run it. Hint: These instructions are `_java -jar mynewaistartup.jar_`.

=== What do we do with these Docker images?

You or your CI/CD server managed to bake your application into a Docker image. But how does that Docker image eventually end up on your target deployment server?

You'll need to push your Docker image to a Docker registry, be that https://hub.docker.com/_/registry[dockerhub], https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/[Amazon ECR] or any of the other gazillion self-hosted container image registries, like https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/container_registry/[Gitlab's], for example.

Once your image made it to said registry, you can https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/[login] to that registry on your targetserver.

[source,console]
----
docker login mysupersecret.registry.com
----

And once you are logged in to your registry, your `_docker run_` will be able to find your custom images.

[source,console]
----
docker run --name my-new-ai-startup -p 80:8080 -d mynewaistartup

//....

SUCCESS!
----

=== Docker Compose: Running more than one container simultaneously

What if your application consists of more than just a single Docker container, say, because you need to run https://www.marcobehler.com/guides/java-microservices-a-practical-guide[98354 microservices]?

https://docs.docker.com/compose/[Docker Compose] to the rescue. You'll define all your services and the dependencies between them (run this one or the other one first) in a good, old, YAML file, a `_compose.yaml_`. Here's an example of such a file, defining two services, a web service and a redis service.

[source,yaml]
----
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8000:5000"
    volumes:
      - .:/code
      - logvolume01:/var/log
    depends_on:
      - redis
  redis:
    image: redis
volumes:
  logvolume01: {}
----

Then you just run `_docker compose up_` and your whole _environment_ (consisting of all your separate services) will be started.

While `_Docker Compose_` might be mainly known for quickly spinning up development or testing environments, it actually works really well for single host deployments as well.
If your application...

* doesn't have any specific high-availability requirements
* you don't mind some manual work (ssh login, docker compose up/down) or using a complementary tool like https://www.ansible.com/[Ansible]
* or you simply don't want to spend enormous amounts of [line-through]#money# investments on a DevOps team

...using Docker Compose for production deployments will go a long way.

=== What do I need Kubernetes for, then?

How can any of the above be true, if seemingly the _whole world_ is using Kubernetes?? Let's find out.

orchestrator....run and manage docker containers..... what does managing containers mean

graphic...plantuml

=== Kubernetes 101: Control Pane

=== Kubernetes 102: Worker Nodes

=== Kubernetes 103: Management

pods
wie
run containers.....healthchecks...self healing....what does that even mean? ubuntu/upstart since the break of dawn: restart hanging processes

=== Why do I as a developer need to know this stuff?

=== How does Kubernetes do all this? YAML!

YAML, YAML, YAML...have a deployment...tell Kubernetes: Go.

== How can I apply this YAML file?

kubectl...

=== Kubectl primer

What is kubectl?

what can kubectl do? apply ? ssh? other stuff?

=== Meet kubeconfig file

kubectl works against a clste.r.....namepsaces..

=== Self-Healing: Lie

self healing: systemd oder supervisord

=== What else can Kubernetes do for me? Secrets Management

=== Don't these YAML files become a mess?

Kustomize / Helm Charts + IDE support

reference kubernetes book...2016 devops...study...would like to have a closer look

Answered: K8s as an abbreviation results from counting the eight letters between the "K" and the "s". https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/#:~:text=rapidly%20growing%20ecosystem.-,Kubernetes%20services%2C%20support%2C%20and%20tools%20are%20widely%20available.,the%20Kubernetes%20project%20in%202014[(source)].

Enough with random, boring facts no one will remember, let's start at the very beginning.

Yet to come. Ssend in a PR btw if you don't like something

nenn mir EIN docker image das du OHNE ZU WISSEN WAS ES TUT einfach wo deployen kannst
du musst auf dockerhub die environment variables lesen
du mussst wissen welche volumes und shit du bereitstellen musst
es ist also nicht "doppelklick app.exe"

rl problem: too little reosurces, killing health-checks, oom, architects, etc.
